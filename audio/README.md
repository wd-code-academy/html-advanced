# Pokémon Cries

In this directory, you'll find audio files for the cries of each Pokémon. Each sub-folder should have a `.mp3` and `.
ogg` file. Some browsers will not be able to play both, so it's important to include both file types so everyone can 
hear.

Sounds will be tested in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
