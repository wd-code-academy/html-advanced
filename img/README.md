# Images

In this directory, you are provided a number of `.png` files for each Pok√©mon. You must use these images in your 
internal `.html` files for each family: `bulbasaur.html`, `charmander.html`, and `squirtle.html`.

These images could be a great way to show display responsive images.

__HINT:__ Bulbasaur evolves into Ivysaur. Ivysaur then evolves into Venusaur. Maybe you could show one photo at a 
time at different screen sizes: small, medium, and large.
